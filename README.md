# DuckDuckGo Privacy Extension (Colin Edition)

DDG has created a lot of separate tools that culminate in their browser extension. With their goal of "privacy simplified", their extension is opinionated and generalized to serve its utilitarian purpose. This version is a more human abomination built to serve my own opinions and open to other contributors.

Visit DDG's [Web Tracking Protections](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/) page to learn how each of our web tracking protections works and how they work together in the browser extensions and apps to provide overlapping protection.
